# Article-text-analysis
This repo aims at scraping the web using BeautifulSoup library of Python and doing analysis of the text such as sentiment analysis, readability analysis, etc.

The article text is first cleaned up by removing stop words from it.
A list of positive and negative words was made for doing sentiment analysis. 
Readability analysis is done in which factors like average word length and fog index are calculated. 
Other measures that are done include:-
1. Complex word count
2. Total word count
3. Average word per sentence
4. Count of personal pronouns
5. average word length

All analyses are done by creating individual functions and running them separately in case there is no need to calculate other factors apart from one.
